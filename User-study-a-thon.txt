The feedback I received:

- Try to prevent error messages by helping the user determine the correct data type (categorical vs. numerical) for the graphs
- Or create different classes for data 
  [Fixed it by disallowing the inappropriate variables to be chosen in the first place]
- Case-sensitive input & a lot of typing
  [Fixed it by replacing user input with buttons]
- Default Database to prevent importing database multiple times when there is an error message
  [Fixed it by creating a shortcut command to load demo data]
- X-axis labels overlap with each other when "Date" is the x-variable
  [Fixed it by adjusting the angle of the text]
- Add a best-fit line for the scatter plot
  [Not enough time to implement this feature :(][But will add it if I continue developing it!]
